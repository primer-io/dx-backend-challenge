# Primer DX Backend Challenge

This is a skeleton project for the Primer DX Backend Challenge. 
It uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) as a framework, but you are welcome to use something else if you are more comfortable.

## Get Started

First thing's first, clone this repo into a private repository on your Github. When you are ready, you can share it with our engineers.

If anything is unclear, Don't hesitate to reach out!

Happy Coding :D

## Running the example app

Start the server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
or via Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

and test it with curl

```bash
